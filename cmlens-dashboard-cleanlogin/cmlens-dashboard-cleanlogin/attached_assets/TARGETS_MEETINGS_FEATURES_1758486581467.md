   - **SC%**: Success calls - super class consumption M1-M4 (Target: >30%)
   - **UP%**: Upselling rate - M-2 cumulative upgrade rate (Target: >15%)
4. **Visual Score Breakdown**: Pie chart showing weighted contribution of each metric to overall score
5. **Smart Recommendations**: Auto-generated improvement suggestions based on weak performance areas with specific action items
6. **Coaching Notes**: Persistent text area to save observations, action plans, and follow-up tasks per agent
7. **Team Comparison**: Statistical table comparing agent performance vs team averages

## ü§ñ **OPENROUTER API INTEGRATION** (AI Enhancement)

**Purpose**: Adds AI-powered coaching insights and discussion points to both features.

**API Configuration**:

- **Model**: `anthropic/claude-3-haiku` (cost-effective, high-quality)
- **Required Secret**: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
- **Base URL**: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`

**How to Get API Key**:
1. Go to https://openrouter.ai
2. Sign up for account
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Generate new API key
5. Add to your environment as `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`

**AI Features**:

**For Targets Tab**:
- **Agent Performance Analysis**: AI reviews agent metrics and generates personalized coaching recommendations
- **Weakness Assessment**: AI identifies root causes behind poor performance areas
- **Action Plan Generation**: AI suggests specific, actionable improvement steps
- **Coaching Strategy**: AI recommends management approach based on performance level

**For Meetings Tab**:
- **Discussion Points**: AI generates specific talking points for each underperforming agent
- **Meeting Questions**: AI suggests constructive questions to ask during 1:1s

**Fallback System**: If API unavailable, system automatically uses rule-based analysis instead

**Cost Estimation**:
- Small team (50 agents): ~$10-20/month
- Medium team (200 agents): ~$40-80/month
- Large team (500 agents): ~$100-200/month

**Security**: API key stored as environment variable, never exposed in frontend

## üìä **DATA REQUIREMENTS**

**Input Data**: Uses same agent data from your existing dashboard
- Agent names, teams, performance metrics (CC%, SC%, UP%, Fixed%)
- No additional data upload needed

**New Database Tables Needed**:
- `coaching_notes`: Store coaching observations per agent
- `meeting_notes`: Store meeting discussion points per agent per week

**Backend Endpoints Required**:
- Save/load coaching notes
- Save/load meeting notes  
- Generate meeting reports
- Optional: AI analysis endpoints

**Important Notes**:
- All percentage values should be stored as decimals (0.0-1.0) and displayed as percentages
- Features work offline without AI if OpenRouter API not configured
- Notes are persistent and searchable by agent/team/date
- Export functionality generates professional meeting reports

This gives managers powerful tools to transform raw performance data into actionable coaching insights and structured meeting agendas.
